          personal data handled by Dymond Fleets: 1. Personal Data Handling At
          Dymond Fleets, we handle essential data selectively to ensure optimal
          service delivery on our transportation platform. The categories of
          data we handle include:Contact Information: This includes personal
          details like your name, phone number, and email address. For specific
          services, we may require additional information, such as your
          residential address.Profile Information: This comprises details such
          as your profile picture, saved addresses, language preferences, and
          communication settings. Certain services may necessitate more
          information, such as your driver's license details.Geolocation: This
          involves determining the precise location of a person or object. It
          helps identify your pick-up location, locate nearby vehicles, track
          travel progress, and determine trip endpoints.Payment Details: We
          handle information such as total billing amounts and the credit card
          used for payment.Communication Records: This includes interactions via
          our in-app chat and conversations with customer support.Device
          Installation Data: When our app is installed on a device, we collect
          limited identification data like the device's IP
          address.Transportation Service Usage Information: This covers data
          related to journey status, timings, and evaluations of commuter
          behaviour based on driver feedback.Vehicle Sensor Information: This
          includes details like vehicle speed, engine power, driving style
          indicators (e.g., abrupt braking), and passenger weight
          variations.User-Generated Content: This encompasses submitted
          feedback, photographs of parked electric vehicles, and audio
          recordings from our safety toolkit's trip audio recording feature
          (where applicable). For more details, contact Dymond Fleets at
          info@dymondfleets.com.In addition to the above sources, we may gather
          data from:Drivers and Third Parties: They provide information related
          to services, potential claims, and disputes.Referral Engagement:
          Individuals actively participating in referral efforts may also
          provide data, which we obtain from the referring user.Insufficient or
          incorrect personal data may impede our ability to fulfill contractual
          obligations or comply with legal requirements. For instance, refusal
          to share geolocation data via the app may prevent us from guiding a
          driver to your location or displaying nearby available vehicles.
          Similarly, declining identity verification may lead to account
          suspension or termination to prevent fraud, thereby affecting our
          ability to serve you effectively. 2. Purpose of Data Processing We
          collect and analyze your personal information to provide you with one
          or more of our transportation services:Connecting Passengers and
          Drivers: Our primary goal is to facilitate connections between
          passengers and drivers, including locating available vehicles for
          hire. We use personal data to link passengers with drivers for pick-up
          and drop-off services or to provide information about nearby hire
          vehicles, such as cars. Processing includes managing instant messages
          within the Dymond Fleets app to support service delivery and resolve
          disputes between drivers and customers. This processing is also
          essential for security, service enhancement, and analytical
          purposes.Facilitating Transportation Services: We assist in
          transportation to desired destinations by providing drivers with
          geolocation data and passengers' phone numbers during ride-hailing.
          This ensures efficient pick-up and drop-off while maintaining journey
          transparency. Geolocation data collection occurs exclusively during
          app usage and stops upon app termination. In some regions, drivers
          receive a temporary number that redirects to the passenger's phone
          number, facilitating effective communication.Optimizing Travel
          Experience: Our aim is to ensure seamless travel by utilizing
          geolocation data to navigate and address service quality concerns. We
          also require location information for accurate billing, battery
          recharging, and fleet maintenance, especially regarding rented
          vehicles.App Optimization and Security: Contact information is used to
          notify passengers and riders about app updates, ensuring continued
          service utilization. We collect limited device data to enhance account
          security through authentication and verification checks.Route
          Optimization: We gather data on passenger and rider routes to assess
          geographic coverage, optimize advice to drivers on optimal routes, and
          strategically position hire vehicles for client convenience.Payment
          Processing: Payment information is collected to facilitate passenger
          payments for ride-hailing and rental vehicles.Standards and User
          Safety: Data on journey statuses, duration, and passenger ratings,
          collected through driver feedback, helps enhance user safety, ensure
          compliance with terms and conditions, and deliver high-quality
          service. Customer support data aids in obtaining feedback and
          resolving service-related disputes and concerns.Communication
          Updates:* Personal information is utilized to communicate journey
          completion, send confirmation slips and receipts, and provide
          important service updates.Vehicle Sensor Analysis: We analyze vehicle
          sensor data for security purposes, identifying potentially hazardous
          driving patterns and sending notifications to promote secure driving
          practices. Notifications regarding significant weight changes aim to
          encourage responsible driving without major repercussions for
          individuals.Legal Claims Processing: Personal data may be processed
          for initiating, carrying out, or defending legal claims, including
          protection against damages or other claims requiring
          examination.Please refer to Clause 3 below for a comprehensive list of
          additional purposes under legitimate interest for processing your
          personal data. 3. Legal Basis for Data Processing We process personal
          information based on legitimate justifications as outlined in the
          methods described above. Before taking any action with your data, we
          ensure there is a valid legal basis for processing.Contractual
          Services: Personal data is processed to fulfill contractual
          obligations through our company's app. This includes providing
          promised services and complying with terms and conditions.Legitimate
          Interest: We often process personal data based on legitimate interest
          grounds after conducting a legitimate interest evaluation. Our
          legitimate interests include delivering an innovative, customized,
          secure, and profitable service to our passengers and partners, unless
          these interests are outweighed by other considerations. We process
          personal data (excluding special categories) for the following
          purposes under legitimate interest:Investigating and identifying
          fraudulent payments, malicious activities, unlawful actions, safety
          incidents, or security events across all data types.Ensuring network
          and system protection and integrity, and addressing suspected or
          confirmed illicit activities promptly.Documenting and evaluating
          communications and instructions through various methods such as email,
          phone calls, and the Dymond Fleets app, for inquiries, substantiation,
          quality assurance, and safeguarding against claims.Developing and
          maintaining features for service security.Establishing, exercising, or
          defending legal claims, including internal investigations, assigning
          claims, utilizing debt collection agencies, and seeking legal
          advice.Other Legal Grounds: Depending on circumstances, we may use
          other legal grounds such as:Compliance with legal obligations,
          including responding to legitimate legal requests to disclose personal
          information to third parties like courts or regulatory
          authorities.Safeguarding critical interests or those of others in
          emergencies or life-threatening situations.Explicit consent from
          individuals for specific purposes, where they have been fully
          informed.In countries where legitimate interest is not a legally
          acceptable reason, we rely on another valid legal basis as mentioned
          above.When personal data is used for a different purpose than its
          original acquisition, and this usage is not based on individual
          permission, we evaluate whether this new usage is allowed. We consider
          factors like:The connection between the reasons for collecting
          personal data and the reasons for planned additional processing.The
          context in which the personal data is collected, especially the
          relationship between you and us.The specific characteristics of the
          personal data, including sensitive categories or criminal
          convictions.The potential impacts of additional processing on
          individuals.The presence of security and privacy measures like
          encryption or pseudonymization.Here's the rewritten version of the
          section on recipients of personal data by Dymond Fleets: 4. Recipients

          partners and authorities, disclosing information only with valid
          justifications and limiting sharing to what is necessary. We do not
          sell your personal information.Ride-Hailing Drivers: Passenger
          personal data is shared with ride-hailing drivers only when a ride is
          initiated through our app. In such cases, drivers gain access to
          passenger name, phone number (which may be hidden in certain
          countries), rating, and geolocation data. Access to passenger name and
          telephone number is available for 24-48 hours post-service. In some
          regions, the telephone number may be hidden. This access enables
          drivers to address passenger concerns, such as returning lost
          items.Feedback Anonymity:* Passenger feedback on ride-hailing service
          quality remains anonymous. Your provided rating is confidential and
          accessible only to you and Dymond Fleets.- *Trusted Representatives:*
          Passenger data may be shared with our trusted representatives,
          affiliates, agents, and others based on passenger location. Data

          in this privacy notice, with additional information available on the
          country-specific customer website.- *Legal Obligations:* We may
          disclose information to external recipients under legal obligations,
          such as Court Orders or collaboration with data protection supervisory
          authorities for complaint resolution or investigations. Additionally,
          we may address inquiries, including those from law enforcement
          entities, if legally mandated in that jurisdiction, serving a public
          interest, impacting users within that jurisdiction, and aligning with

          arrangement. Messages are customized based on your service usage data.

          emails or opt-out within the app's profile section.Here's the
          rewritten version of the section on automated decision-making: 9.
          Automated Decision-Making Automated decision-making involves computer
          algorithms and artificial intelligence making decisions without human
          intervention. We utilize automated decision-making to issue warnings
          and implement ride-hailing service suspensions, ensuring reduced error
          rates, enhanced efficiency, and heightened safety compared to manual
          processes. When determining the need for a warning or suspension, we
          consider your transportation service usage data, including journey
          status (e.g., cancellations, no-shows) and behavioral assessments by
          drivers. Additional details on automated decision-making are available
          [here](link to information page).- *Suspensions:* Ride-hailing
          suspensions last for six months, after which access is
          reinstated.Automated decision-making is also used for fraud checks to
          ensure proper payment for services and protect riders from fraudulent
          transactions. It may authenticate your identity and aid in resolving
          complaints. Complaints submitted via our chat function generate an
          automatic response, reviewed by a human agent for final decisions. If
          automated processing significantly impacts your rights, you have the
          right to request human intervention and object to automated decisions
          or profiling. You can voice your perspective and contest decisions by
          contacting customer support through our app. You may also request an
          explanation of automated decision-making reasoning. Some cases may not
          allow objection to automated decision-making per regulations. Clear
          information on your rights and objection procedures will be provided.
          10. Conflict Resolution Disputes regarding personal data handling can
          be initially resolved through our customer assistance via phone call
          or email at (info@dymondfleets.com). Please caption the email
          appropriately. You can also contact our Data Protection Officer at the
          same email address if necessary. Additionally, the country's Data
          Protection Inspectorate serves as our supervisory authority. If you
          believe we have unlawfully processed your data or not fulfilled our
          legal duties, you have the right to file a complaint with the
          supervisory authority. 11. Enhancing Message Quality We trust that you
          have easily understood our privacy notice. Data protection laws are
          crucial as they enhance regulations and bolster your rights to access
          information. While some of these laws may seem complex, they are
          generally based on fundamental logic. We prioritize our
          responsibilities regarding the security and confidentiality of your
          data. Dymond Fleets will consistently update this privacy notice as
          part of our commitment to safeguarding your privacy and providing
          enhanced transparency
